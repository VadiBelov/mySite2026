			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
			<p>
			In the modern era of digitalization, information is becoming increasingly accessible, while its volume is growing at a tremendous pace. Under these conditions, the ability to efficiently record, structure, and analyze spoken language becomes particularly important. Automatic transcription is the process of converting speech into text with minimal human involvement. With the development of web technologies, automatic speech-to-text conversion is increasingly implemented in the form of online services.
			</p>

			<p>
			A web-based automatic transcription system is a software solution that enables real-time or offline conversion of audio recordings or live speech into text using modern speech recognition algorithms. Such systems can be applied in various fields, including education, medicine, mass media, and legal practice.
			</p>

			<h2>1. Relevance of the Topic</h2>
			
			<p>
			The relevance of developing web-based automatic transcription systems is driven by the growing volume of audio content and the need for its rapid processing. The expansion of distance learning, online conferences, and digital services has led to an increase in audio and video materials requiring transcription. Manual transcription under these conditions becomes inefficient and costly.
			</p>
			<p>
			An additional factor contributing to relevance is the advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, which have significantly improved speech recognition accuracy. Modern algorithms are capable of taking contextual information, phonetic features of language, and acoustic characteristics of audio signals into account. The social importance of such systems is also noteworthy, as they enhance information accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments and contribute to digital inclusion.
			</p>
			<p>
			This, the development of a web-based automatic transcription system meets the demands of modern digital society and represents a promising area of scientific and applied research.

			<h2>2. Research Goals and Objectives, Expected Results</h2>

			<p>
			The goal of this research is to develop a web-based automatic transcription system that ensures accurate conversion of spoken language into text while providing ease of use for end users.
			</p>

			<p>
			To achieve this goal, the study involves examining the theoretical foundations of automatic speech recognition, analyzing existing software solutions and scientific publications, and designing the architecture of a web-based system with consideration for scalability and performance requirements. Special attention is given to the selection of technologies and tools that enable the implementation of the system as an accessible and functional web application.
			</p>

				<p>
			The expected outcomes include the creation of a prototype web-based automatic transcription system, a description of its architectural and software solutions, and the formulation of recommendations for further development and practical application.

			<h2>3.  Review of Research and Developments</h2>
			

			<p>
			Automatic speech recognition is one of the key areas of natural language processing and has been actively studied for several decades. The evolution of speech recognition methods is closely related to advances in computational power and machine learning algorithms.
			</p>

			<h3>3.1 Review of International Sources</h3>

			<p>
			International research places significant emphasis on the use of statistical and neural network models for speech signal processing. Early automatic speech recognition systems were based on hidden Markov models, which effectively described the temporal structure of speech signals. With the advent of deep neural networks, more complex models capable of capturing context and nonlinear dependencies have emerged.
			</p>

			<p>
			Contemporary studies focus on recurrent neural networks, LSTM architectures, and transformer models, which demonstrate high recognition accuracy under real-world conditions. Major technology companies have made substantial contributions by offering cloud-based speech recognition services that are widely used in web applications due to their ease of integration, multilingual support, and scalability.
			</p>

			<a name="p32"></a>
			<h3>3.2 Review of National Sources</h3>

			<p>
			In national research, particular attention is given to adapting speech recognition systems to the characteristics of the Russian language, which is distinguished by complex morphology and flexible word order. Studies focus on the development of phonetic and lexical models optimized for Russian, as well as on methods for preprocessing audio signals to improve recognition quality.
			</p>

			<p>
			Several works address the application of automatic transcription in educational and corporate information systems. It is noted that hybrid approaches combining statistical methods and neural network algorithms demonstrate the highest effectiveness.
			</p>

			<h2>4. Development of a Web-Based Automatic Transcription System</h2>

			<p>
			The development of a web-based automatic transcription system involves creating a software complex consisting of a user interface, a server-side component, and a speech recognition module. The user interface enables interaction with the system and provides options for uploading audio files or recording speech in real time. The server component handles request processing, data management, and interaction with speech recognition services.
			</p>

			<p>
			The system may utilize either a local speech recognition model deployed on a server or a cloud-based service providing an appropriate programming interface. The choice of solution depends on accuracy requirements, processing speed, and data confidentiality considerations. A database may be used to store transcription results and user settings, enabling history tracking and repeated access to data.
			</p>

			<p>
			The development process includes architectural design, implementation of software modules, component integration, and system testing on various audio datasets. Special attention is given to handling noise, variations in speech tempo, and speaker accents, as these factors significantly affect transcription quality.
			</p>

			<a name="p5"></a>
			<h2>Conclusions</h2>

			<p>
			The conducted research demonstrates that web-based automatic transcription systems are in demand and represent a promising tool in the context of societal digitalization. The use of modern speech recognition algorithms significantly improves the efficiency of audio content processing and reduces the costs associated with manual transcription.
			</p>

			<p>
			An analysis of existing research and developments indicates that solutions based on neural network models adapted to specific languages and usage conditions offer the highest effectiveness. The development of a web-based automatic transcription system requires a comprehensive approach encompassing both technical and linguistic aspects.
			</p>

			<p>
			The proposed concept of a web-based system can be applied across various fields and may serve as a foundation for further research and practical developments in automatic speech processing.
